        <!-- Assignment #50 - While Loops -->
        <h3>Assignment #50: While Loops</h3>
        <p>Clicking ths button will start a loop, starting with X = 1, calulate X to power of 2, output the result then increment X by 1 until X is equal to 12.</p>
        <p = id = "Loop"></p> <!-- Output current value of ID 'Loop' to the browser window -->
        <button onclick = "assign50()">Click here to execute the loop</button><br><br> <!-- When the user clicks the button JS function'assign50' executes -->
        
        <!-- Challenge #13 - String Length Property -->
        <h3>Challenge #13: String Length Property</h3>
        <p>Using the '.length()' method will work out how many characters long the string <strong>'Live A Live is a remake of a previously Japan-only 1994 J-RPG which was released for the Super Famicom'</strong> is and output the result below.</p>
        <button onclick = "challenge13()">Click me to find out how long the string is</button> <!-- When user clicks on the button JS function 'challenge13' executes and stores the result in ID 'Length' -->
        <p id = "Length"></p> <!-- Display the value of ID 'Length' -->

        <!-- Assignment #51 - For Loops -->
        <h3>Assignment #51: For Loops</h3>
        <p>We have an array with the names of five computer games, clicking the button below will iterate through the array and output the name of each on one line after another.</p>
        <button onclick = "assign51()">Games I am currently playing</button> <!-- When the user clicks the button JS function 'assign51' executes and sets the value of ID 'Games' to whatever the output is -->
        <p id = "Games"></p> <!-- Display the value of ID 'Games' -->

        <!-- Assignment #52 - Arrays -->
        <h3>Assignment #52: Arrays</h3>
        <p>We have an array containing a list of games we could play next. Click the button below to execute a JS function which will randomly pick one of those games.</p>
        <button onclick = "assign52()">What should I play next</button> <!-- When user clicks the button JS function 'assign52' executes and the value it returns is stored in ID 'Next' -->
        <p id = "Next"></p> <!-- Output value of ID 'Next' to the browser window -->

        <!-- Assignment #53 - Const Keyword -->
        <h3>Assignment #53 - Const Keyword</h3>
        <p>We have a const object called "Video_Game" with four properties name, developer, genre and price, click the button below to output a string using some of those object properties.</p>
        <button onclick = "assign53()">Learn more about Trails of Cold Steel</button> <!-- When the user clicks the button JS function 'assign53' executes and stores the result in ID 'Constant' -->
        <p id = "Constant"></p> <!-- Output the value of ID 'Constant' to the browser window -->
        <p>We are now going to change a property of the "Video_Game" object, we will change the genre from "J-RPG" to "Action RPG" and also add a new property to the object "Platform". Click the button below to see the change to the "genre" property and the new "Platform" property.</p>
        <p id = "Updated_Constant"></p> <!-- Output the value of ID 'Updated_Constant' to the browser window -->

        <!-- Assignment #54 - Let Keyword -->
        <h3>Assignment #54 - Let Keyword</h3>
        <p>Clicking on the button will show how the let and var keywords differ. The middle string is assigned using the let keyword in it's own block of code and can only be accessed from within that block. When we try to access the same variable again outside the block we access the first version again as that has global scope whereas the let version does not.</p>
        <button onclick = "assign54()">Example of the let keyword and function and block scope</button><br><br> <!-- Execute JS function 'assign54' which will takes use to a new page as it make use of the document.write method -->

        <!-- Challenge #14 - Return Statement -->
        <h3>Challenge #14 - Return Statement</h3>
        <p>The value below is calculated by taking the numbers 4 and 16 passing them into a function called 'challenge16' which will then return the value of 4 to the power of 16 through use of the return statement. This function is executed automatically when the page loads.
        <p id = "Return"></p> <!-- Output the value of ID 'Return' to the browser window -->

        <!-- Assignment #55 - Objects -->
        <h3>Assignment #55 - Objects</h3>
        <p>The below string of text is made of up of properties of the 'product' object using the notes() method which run off the object.</p>
        <strong><p id = "Object"></p></strong> <!-- Output the value of ID 'Object' to the browser window -->

        <!-- Challenge #15 - Break and Continue Statements -->
        <h3>Challenge #15 - Break and Continue Statements</h3>
        <p>This is a demonstration of how the break and continue statements work. The break statement ends a loop when it is used, whereas continue will end the current iteration of the loop and restart it.This loop executes until it get to ten then it breaks.</p>
        <button onclick = "challenge15()">Execute</button> <!-- When user clicks button JS function 'challenge15' executes -->
        <p id ="Counter"></p> <!-- Output the value of ID 'Counter' to the browser window -->
