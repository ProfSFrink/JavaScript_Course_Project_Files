# __JavaScript Course Project Files__

## __Advanced Software and Web Developer: Part VI: JavaScript__

## __by Steven Partlow__

A repository for all of the coding projects we will undertake as on the JavaScript Course as part of the Advanced Software and Web Developer Diploma.

## __Basic JavaScript Projects__

---
These projects are simple excerises which demonstrate the various aspects of JavaScript as a programming language.

### __Project 1: Expression Alerts__

---
Various of examples of using the alert method and the document.write method plus several examples of string concatenation.

### __Project 2: Functions__

---
A small number of examples using functions alongside the getElementById method to alter HTML elements and display the results in the browser

### __Project 3: Math Operators__

---
Several examples of the use of math operators in JavaScript such as the +, -, *, /, %, ++, -- operators along with a few functions that use the Math object alongside the random() and sqrt() methods.

### __Project 4: Dictionaries__

---
Multiple functions that show the use of dictionaries and key-value pairs, including declaring a dictionary with multiple KVPs and pulling values from them based on their keys, making use of the getDocumentById() method and HTML event handlers. Then demonstrate what happens when using duplicate keys and how the delete operator works on a dictionary and the resulting output.

### __Project 5: Comparisons / Type Coercion / Logical Operators__

---
Multiple code examples of Type coercion through use of the 'typeof' method that show various different data types. Show the data type 'Not A Number' in the browser window, along with example uses of the isNaN() method being used. Then multiple comparisons operations which make use of various logical operators such as <, >, >=, <=, ==, ===, &&, ||, and !.

### __Project 6: Ternary Operators and Constructors__

---
Two example functions which show the user of ternary operators, one using the provided example of a function which determines if a person is tall enough to go on a ride, then a second example of a person being old enough to vote. Then examples of object constructors making use of the 'new' and 'this' keyword, again using a provided example as a vehicle as one example of a constructor and then one of my making which is a video game object. Then finally an example of a nested function which calculates a set number to the power of 8 and displays the output in an HTML element.

### __Project 7: Scope / Time Function and Conditional Statements__

---
Examples of the use of both local and global variables as well use of the console.log() method to show what happens when we attempt to access a local variable outside the function that it's declared in. Then examples of conditional statements using IF / ELSE and ELSE IF along with uses of the Date() module, getHours() method. These include using an IF statement and the Math() modules Random() method to determine a coin toss then use of both IF and ELSE statements to see if a customer is old enough to be served at the checkout of a grocery store and the Time_function() (Named assign43() here) to workout what time of the day it is.

### __Project 8: String Methods__

---
Several examples that show use of strings methods such as concat(), slice(), toString(), and toPrecision() and accompanying HTML elements to display them in the browser window. Then an example of the toUpperCase() method to convert a string to uppercase and the search() method to find a word within a string and return it's index position then an example of the toFixed() method which converts a number to a string to a specified number of decimal places and finally a explanation of the valueOf() method and what it does and why we should rarely have to use it.

### __Project 9: Countdown / Slideshow__

---
An example of a countdown timer using JavaScript which allows the user to input a time in seconds and then show the timer countdown and then pop an alert when the timer reaches zero, this is done through use of the setTimeout() method and the tick keyword. Then finally an example of a basic slideshow which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript following the w3schools tutorial, this shows the first use of for loops on this course along with using JavaScript to adjust CSS class names and properties on the fly.

### __Challenges: Async / Defer__

---
Two examples which show how the Async and Defer attributes work within JavaScript by attempt to display the content of a HTML element within an alert window but the alert method references the ID before it is parsed in the HTML code.
