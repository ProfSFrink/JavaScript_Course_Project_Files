## __Part VI: JavaScript__

## __by Steven Partlow__

A repository for all of the coding projects undertaken as part of the JavaScript Course for the Advanced Software and Web Developer Diploma.

## __Main Project #1: Tic Tac Toe Game__

___
The first major project of this course involves using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a Tic Tac Toe game. The game has you playing against the computer until either a tie or a winner is declared and then the game board is reset and you start over again. This was a code-along project were we typed the code out step-by-step and then slowly going through what each piece of the code is doing and how the various functions interact with one another. This goes over all the concepts covered in the course thus far and brings them all together, such as conditional statements, loops, functions and also covers a few new things such as using the 'Arrow' function to write simpler, cleaner functions and calling the .some() method off an array. Plus we use some CSS to style the game and also customised the graphics and sound.

## __Main Project #2: Calculator__

___
The second project was again a code-along assignment where we utilise HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application that functions as a calculator and allows for basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, along with the ability to clear the calculator and reset back to default. New coding methods introduced in this include document.querySelector() method and the parseFloat() and the use of exclamation points '!' as a 'NOT' statement. The calculator is styled using CSS with customised colours and fonts.

## __Main Project #3: Pizza Menu Project__

___
The third project is a Pizza Menu project which again uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web site which allows the user to order a pizza by selecting a size, then a choice of both vegetable and meat toppings, then through use of JavaScript we calculate the cost of the pizza and all the toppings and output the result. We also give the user the first topping for free and account for this is in our code. This site uses most of the techniques learned on the course thus far.

## __Main Project #4: One-page Website JavaScript Update__

___
We return to the One-page Web site from the HTML and CSS courses, this time we add a lightshow (modal) to replace the existing screenshot section of the site, which whenever you click on one of the screenshots it will display that image full screen, you also have buttons to cycle through the images as well as thumbnail images beneath the main image which will display the relevant image when clicked on. This was done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the Javascript tracks the current active screenshot and through use of HTML elements decided which is currently visable to the user. This lightshow is based off the demo one found on w3schools.com but I customised it to work with the code of my site.

## __Main Project #5: Bootstrap 4 Tutorial Website JavaScript Update__

___
We add JavaScript to the Hobby Blog site we did as part of the CSS course by adding a popover to the submit e-mail address button then we add a modal form so the user can sign up to the site and be updated about new releases both of these are done using jQuery. Then for challenge 26 the new bootstrap component I choose to add was simple set of list boxes showing some new releases.

## __Main Project #6: To Do App__

___
Using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript create a simple To Do App in a web browser that allows the user to add and remove tasks from the to do list, this is done through use of the JSON stringify() and parse() methods to convert JSON objects to strings and back again. We also make use of the localStorage() methods to store the contents of the To do list in the broswers local storage on the computer. The app has also had some basic styling applied using CSS.

## __Main Project #7: Personal Portfolio Website JavaScript Update__

___
__URL:__ <a href = "http://stevenpartlow.com/">http://www.stevenpartlow.com/</a>

We took the personal portfolio website that we created as part of the CSS and Bootstrap course and upgraded it with JavaScript functionality by adding a popup contact form to the website, which can be accessed by either the sticky contact button in the bottom right of the page or by clicking on the contact link in the sites navbar,when the form is submitted the content is sent to 'formspree.io'. The second JavaScript feature added is an image slideshow which replaces the static image of myself and now contains a series of images which show a picture of myself and images showcasing my various skills along with a final image which links to my GitHub profile. Have also upgraded the sites CSS so that the site scales better on mobile devices and have tested the site on an iPhone and an android galaxy tablet, this was done by changing all sizes to vw units instead of pixels so that the site scales better depending on the device being used. The sites general styling has been changed and updated plus I cleaned up the CSS where need as there was some excess repetition in the code.

## __JavaScript Projects__

___
These projects start with more examples of built in JavaScript keywords and methods, starting with the switch statement and then use of the .getElementByClassName() method and use of the HTML canvas element and the use of JavaScript to draw in it, and finally an example of using JavaScript to perform form validation checks. Then an example of using the HTML data attribute in conjunction with JavaScript.

## __React Projects__

___
Four simple excerises to demonstrate some of the basics of the React library these include using React to create a timer, a like button, using JSX (React JavaScript XML) and making your own simple react app from the command line.

## __Portfolio Web Site Challenges__

___
These challenges are to help prepare for the main project of upgrading the portfolio web site with JavaScript. These include learning how to use VW unit size for fonts, fade in effects, form validation, a popup contact form, zooming in and out of an image using CSS, smooth page scrolling, automatic slide shows utilising jQuery and sticky contact buttons.

## __Basic JavaScript Projects__

___
These projects are simple excerises which demonstrate the various aspects of JavaScript as a programming language.

### __Project 1: Expression Alerts__

___
Various of examples of using the alert method and the document.write method plus several examples of string concatenation.

### __Project 2: Functions__

___
A small number of examples using functions alongside the getElementById method to alter HTML elements and display the results in the browser

### __Project 3: Math Operators__

___
Several examples of the use of math operators in JavaScript such as the +, -, *, /, %, ++, -- operators along with a few functions that use the Math object alongside the random() and sqrt() methods.

### __Project 4: Dictionaries__

___
Multiple functions that show the use of dictionaries and key-value pairs, including declaring a dictionary with multiple KVPs and pulling values from them based on their keys, making use of the getDocumentById() method and HTML event handlers. Then demonstrate what happens when using duplicate keys and how the delete operator works on a dictionary and the resulting output.

### __Project 5: Comparisons / Type Coercion / Logical Operators__

___
Multiple code examples of Type coercion through use of the 'typeof' method that show various different data types. Show the data type 'Not A Number' in the browser window, along with example uses of the isNaN() method being used. Then multiple comparisons operations which make use of various logical operators such as <, >, >=, <=, ==, ===, &&, ||, and !.

### __Project 6: Ternary Operators and Constructors__

___
Two example functions which show the user of ternary operators, one using the provided example of a function which determines if a person is tall enough to go on a ride, then a second example of a person being old enough to vote. Then examples of object constructors making use of the 'new' and 'this' keyword, again using a provided example as a vehicle as one example of a constructor and then one of my making which is a video game object. Then finally an example of a nested function which calculates a set number to the power of 8 and displays the output in an HTML element.

### __Project 7: Scope / Time Function and Conditional Statements__

___
Examples of the use of both local and global variables as well use of the console.log() method to show what happens when we attempt to access a local variable outside the function that it's declared in. Then examples of conditional statements using IF / ELSE and ELSE IF along with uses of the Date() module, getHours() method. These include using an IF statement and the Math() modules Random() method to determine a coin toss then use of both IF and ELSE statements to see if a customer is old enough to be served at the checkout of a grocery store and the Time_function() (Named assign43() here) to workout what time of the day it is.

### __Project 8: String Methods__

___
Several examples that show use of strings methods such as concat(), slice(), toString(), and toPrecision() and accompanying HTML elements to display them in the browser window. Then an example of the toUpperCase() method to convert a string to uppercase and the search() method to find a word within a string and return it's index position then an example of the toFixed() method which converts a number to a string to a specified number of decimal places and finally a explanation of the valueOf() method and what it does and why we should rarely have to use it.

### __Project 9: Countdown / Slideshow__

___
An example of a countdown timer using JavaScript which allows the user to input a time in seconds and then show the timer countdown and then pop an alert when the timer reaches zero, this is done through use of the setTimeout() method and the tick keyword. Then finally an example of a basic slideshow which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript following the w3schools tutorial, this shows the first use of for loops on this course along with using JavaScript to adjust CSS class names and properties on the fly.

### __Challenges: Async / Defer plus Uncaught Syntax Assignment__

___
Two examples which show how the Async and Defer attributes work within JavaScript by attempt to display the content of a HTML element within an alert window but the alert method references the ID before it is parsed in the HTML code. Plus a simple piece of code to demonstrate how to catch syntax errors using dev tools.

### __Project 10: Loops and Arrays__

___
This project cover loops with examples of both while and for loops shown alongwith use of the length property to use a loop to iterate through an array, which the use of is also demonstarted here including using the Math.random() method to randomly select and output a value from within an array. Then use of both the const and let keywords are shown also with an explaination of both function and block scope, this also shows using the let keyword to create an object with both properties and methods. Then finally examples of use of the return statement in functions and utilizing the break and continue statement to control loops.

### __Challenge: AJAX Challenge__

___
A quick follow-on tutorial on how to use AJAX through installing XAMPP. This is a simple website which demonstrates setting up an XMLHttpRequest and then successfully executing it. Shows use of the XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript and use of the onreadystatechange and readyState properties to pull some text from a web server.

### __Challenge: jQuery Challenge__

___
Another quick follow-on tutorial on how to link to and use the jQuery JavaScript library then a demonstration of and use of jQuery events through use of the .hover() method and jQuery effects with the .hide() method.
