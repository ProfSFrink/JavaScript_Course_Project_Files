A small number of examples using functions alongside the getElementById method to alter HTML elements and display the results in the browser

### Project 3 - Math Operators
---
Several examples of the use of math operators in JavaScript such as the +, -, *, /, %, ++, -- operators along with a few functions that use the Math object alongside the random() and sqrt() methods.

### Project 4 - Dictionaries
---
Multiple functions that show the use of dictionaries and key-value pairs, including declaring a dictionary with multiple KVPs and pulling values from them based on their keys, making use of the getDocumentById() method and HTML event handlers. Then demonstrate what happens when using duplicate keys and how the delete operator works on a dictionary and the resulting output.
