                        <h3>My thoughts on the game</h3>
                        <p>Triangle Strategy is turn-based strategy RPG developeed by japanese studio Artdink whose recent titles include <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler" target = "_blank">Octopath Traveller</a> while that game was a traditional turn-based JRPG, Triangle Strategy is a turn-based strategy RPG in the same vain as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" target = "_blank">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem" target = "_blank">Fire Emblem</a>. The game utilizes the same HD-2D artstyle that octopath used with character sprites being 2D and the levels themselves being styled in the vain of 3D dioramas.<br> 
                            
                        <br>The game is set in on the fictional continent of Norzella, where the game is set thirty yaers after "The Saltiron War" in which the two main kingdoms Aesfrost and Hyzante fought over the scares resources of salt and iron, the war was eventually ended by the kingdom of Glenbrook who helped push Aesfrost back and end the war and negoitate a peace treaty. The game begins with the three kingdom opening a mine as a joint-venture to promote peace between the three kingdoms. However Aesfrost assassins have Dragan the Aesfrost minister overseeing the mine murdered and falsly accuses Gleenbrook of being the perpertrator and Aesfrost invades Gleenbrook. You play as Lord Serenoa Wolfort, heir to house Wolfort one of th three great houses of Glenbrook.<br> 
                        
                        <br>The battles in the game play as turn-based battle on a grid with the turn order shown on the bottom of the screen, this is important as you can plan who to attack next knowing which units turns are coming up. Positioning is very important in battles, attacking an enemy from the rear will result in increaed damage, if an allied unit is on the opposite side of the enemy unit they will join in the attack as well for extra damage, however the same rules apply to enemy units so you must try to position your units so they are not exposed. In between battles, there is an encampment which allows you to customise your characters, each character is unique with there own abilities, with further abilities being unlocked as you characters level up. The only equipment is simple accessories with weapons being upgraded through crafting, in addition you can also purchase passive abilities to boost stats and damage from weapons and spells. There are also exploration segments that allow you to talk to your allies but also the local townspeople in the area you are currently in, this also unlocks additional dialogue options for the other gameplay mechanic "The Scales of Conviction" where you make story decsions by having key party members vote on the path you should take, the additional dialogue options you unlock in the exploration segments can be used to sway allies into voting in a certain way. These moments are when the story can branch into different directions depending on the outcome of the vote. The game has four different endings depending on the path you take through the story one leading to the games true ending, the game does feature a new game plus option allowing you to carry all your characters and progress through to a second playthrough, you can also skip cutscenes and fast-forward battles to speed up any future playthroughs. The game is designed with multiple playthroughs in mind as you cannot unlock all the characters in one playthrough.<br>
                        
                        <br>This does lead to one issue with the game as there are a lot of cutscenes in between story battles, sometimes over an hours worth and this can hurt the games pacing, the story and characters are actually very good but the dialogue is very wordy, the script could have done with an editor. The battles themselves however are excellent with fantastic map design where based on the level layout you may need to bring in different party memebers to utilize the terrain to your advantage, if a level has a lot of high ground for example you may want to bring extra archers as they give bonus damage when attacking from elevated positions.</p>
